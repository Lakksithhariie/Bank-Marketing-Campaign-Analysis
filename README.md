## What is this project?

This project is about understanding bank customers and predicting if they will subscribe to a term deposit (a type of savings account).  We used computer learning (Machine Learning) to look at data from a bank's marketing campaigns and figure out what makes people say "yes" or "no".

## Where did the data come from?

The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find it here:

[Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing)

## What did I do?

I followed these main steps:

1.  **Looked at the Data:**  Explored the data to understand what it's about and find patterns.
2.  **Prepared the Data:** Cleaned and organized the data so the computer could understand it.
3.  **Built Computer Models:** Used Machine Learning models to predict who would subscribe.
4.  **Checked How Good the Models Are:**  Evaluated how well the models predicted subscriptions.
5.  **Found Important Things:**  Discovered what factors are most important for predicting if someone will subscribe.

## What are the main findings?

*   It's easier to predict who will say "no" than who will say "yes" to a term deposit.
*   Things like interest rates, age, and job type are important factors.
*   If the bank focuses on customers who are likely to say "yes" (based on the model), they can be much more successful with their marketing.

## How can you run this code?

1.  **Open in Google Colab:** Click the badge at the top that says "Open In Colab". This will open the project in your web browser.
2.  **Run the code:**  Go through the notebook step-by-step and run each code cell.

You'll need to have these Python libraries installed (they are usually installed in Colab already):

*   pandas
*   matplotlib
*   seaborn
*   scikit-learn
*   imblearn

You can install them if needed using `pip install library_name`.
